# AI-based-New-product-launch-and-Marketing-forecast
The algorithm developed, forecast the demand of the newly launched product with nearly zero historical data. The training dataset contains 1303 models of different laptops with 13 attributes.
The test cas will be the newly launched product. The algorithm finds the top 5 analogous laptops with using layerd clustering (unsupervised ML algorithms) followed by the Bass Difussion Model to forecast the demand based on the sales of those five analogous models. Since the sales of models is a confidential data, here sales data is genrated randomly everytime.
